git stash: git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy
so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on. Stashing is
handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else, but you're mid-way
through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
git stash (OR) git stash save "Updated some code" :
git stash list :
git stash show : This command shows the summary of the stash diffs.
The above command considers only the latest stash.
git stash show -p : It will give you the detailed list of differences.
git stash show stash@{1}:
git stash apply stash@{0}:
git stash drop stash@{0} :
